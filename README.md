# Bharat-intern_internship_Tasks

In this repository I was Done 3 Tasks -

1) Stock analysis using Machine Learning and LSTM : 

--> Take stock price of any company we want and predicts its price by using LSTM. 

2) Titanic Classification :
   
--> It is a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status,
    age, gender and more.

--> Data Sets Is taken from the kaggle.
   
3) Number Recognition Using DeepLearning & MNIST Datasets :
   
-->Handwritten digit recognition system not only detects scanned images of handwritten digits.Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a major project
    made with the help of Neural Network. It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits.

All Above Task Is Done in JupterNotebook..
